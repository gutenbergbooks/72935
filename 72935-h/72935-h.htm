<p><span class="smcap">The</span> window rattled, the gate swung, a leaf
rose, and the kitten chased it, ‘whoo-oo’ the
faintest sound in the keyhole. I looked up, and
saw the feathers on a sparrow’s breast ruffled
for an instant. It was quiet for some time:
after a while it came again with heavier purpose.
The folded shutters shook; the latch of the
kitchen door rattled as if some one were lifting
it and dropped it; indefinite noises came from
up-stairs: there was a hand in the house moving
everything. Another pause. The kitten was
curled up on the window-ledge outside in the
sunshine, just as the sleek cats curled up in the
warmth at Thebes of old Egypt five or six thousand
years ago; the sparrow was happy at the
rose-tree; a bee was happy on a broad dandelion
disc. ‘Soo-hoo!’—a low whistle came through
the chink; a handful of rain was flung at the
window; a great shadow rushed up the valley
and strode the house in an instant as you would
get over a stile. I put down my book and
buttoned my coat. Soo-hoo! the wind was here
and the cloud—soo-hoo! drawing out longer and
more plaintive in the thin mouthpiece of the
chink. The cloud had no more rain in it, but
it shut out the sun; and all that afternoon and
all that night the low plaint of the wind continued
in sorrowful hopelessness, and little sounds
ran about the floors and round the rooms.</p>

<p>Still soo-hoo all the next day and sunlessness,
turning the mind, through work and conversation,
to pensive notes. At even, the edge of the cloud
lifted over the forest hill westwards, and a yellow
glow, the great beacon-fire of the sun, burned
out, a conflagration at the verge of the world.
In the night, awaking gently as one who is
whispered to—listen! Ah! All the orchestra
is at work—the keyhole, the chink, and the
chimney; whoo-hooing in the keyhole, whistling
shrill whew-w-w! in the chink, moaning long
and deep in the chimney. Over in the field the
row of pines was sighing; the wind lingered and
clung to the close foliage, and each needle of the
million, million leaflets drew its tongue across
the organ blast. A countless multitude of sighs
made one continued distant undertone to the
wild roar of the gable close at hand. Something
seemed to be running with innumerable centipede
feet over the mouth of the chimney, for the
long deep moan, as I listened, resolved itself
into a quick succession of touches, just as you
might play with your finger-tips tattooing on
the hollow table. In the midst of the clangour,
the hearing settled down to the sighing of the
pines, which drew the mind towards it, and
soothed the senses to sleep.</p>

<p>Towards dawn, awake again—another change:
the battering-ram at work now against the walls.
Swinging back, the solid thickness of the wind
came forward—crush! as the iron-shod ram’s head
hanging from its chains rushed to the tower.
Crush! It sucked back again as if there had
been a vacuum—a moment’s silence and crush!
Blow after blow—the floor heaved; the walls
were ready to come together—alternate sucking
back and heavy billowy advance. Crush! crash!
Blow after blow, heave and batter and hoist, as
if it would tear the house up by the roots.
Forty miles that battering-ram wind had travelled
without so much as a bough to check it
till it struck the house on the hill. Thud! thud!
as if it were iron, and not air. I looked from
the window, and the bright morning star was
shining—the sky was full of the wind and the
star. As light came, the thud, thud, sunk away,
and nothing remained but the whoo-hoo-hoo of
the keyhole and the moan of the chimney.
These did not leave us; for four days and nights
the whoo-hoo-hoo-whoo never ceased a moment.
Whoo-hoo! whoo! and this is the wind on the
hill indoors.</p>

<p>Out of doors, sometimes in the morning, deep
in the valley, over the tree-tops of the forest,
there stays a vapour, lit up within by sunlight.
A glory hovers over the oaks—a cloud of light
hundreds of feet thick, the air made visible by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">{498}</span>
surcharge and heaviness of sunbeams, pressed
together till you can see them in themselves and
not reflected. The cloud slants down the sloping
wood, till in a moment it is gone, and the beams
are now focused in the depth of the narrow
valley. The mirror has been tilted, and the
glow has shifted; in a moment more it has
vanished into space, and the dream has gone
from the wood. In the arms of the wind, vast
bundles of mist are borne against the hill; they
widen and slip, and lengthen, drawing out; the
wind works quickly with moist colours ready
and a wide brush laying broadly. Colour
comes up in the wind; the thin mist disappears,
drunk up in the grass and trees, and the air
is full of blue behind the vapour. Blue sky
at the far horizon—rich deep blue overhead—a
dark-brown blue deep yonder in the gorge
among the trees. I feel a sense of blue colour
as I face the strong breeze; the vibration and
blow of its force answer to that hue, the sound
of the swinging branches and the rush—rush
in the grass is azure in its note; it is wind-blue,
not the night-blue, or heaven-blue, a
colour of air. To see the colour of the air,
it needs great space like this—a vastness of
concavity and hollow—an equal caldron of
valley and plain under, to the dome of the
sky over, for no vessel of earth and sky is too
large for the air-colour to fill. Thirty, forty,
and more miles of eye-sweep, and beyond that
the limitless expanse over the sea—the thought
of the eye knows no butt, shooting on with stellar
penetration into the unknown. In a small space
there seems a vacuum, and nothing between you
and the hedge opposite, or even across the valley;
in a great space the void is filled, and the wind
touches the sight like a thing tangible. The
air becomes itself a cloud, and is coloured—recognised
as a thing suspended; something real exists
between you and the horizon. Now, full of sun
and now of shade, the air-cloud rests in the
expanse.</p>

<p>It is summer, and the wind-birds top the
furze; the bright stonechat, velvet-black and red
and white, sits on the highest spray of the
gorse, as if he were painted there. He is always
in the wind on the hill, from the hail of April
to August’s dry glow. All the mile-long slope
of the hill under me is purple-clad with heath
down to the tree-filled gorge where the green
boughs seem to join the purple. The cornfields
and the pastures of the plain—count them one
by one till the hedges and squares close together
and cannot be separated. The surface of the
earth melts away as if the eyes insensibly shut
and grew dreamy in gazing, as the soft clouds
melt and lose their outline at the horizon. But
dwelling there, the glance slowly finds and fills
out something that interposes its existence between
us and the further space. Too shadowy for the
substance of a cloud, too delicate for outline
against the sky, fainter than haze, something of
which the eye has consciousness, but cannot put
into a word to itself. Something is there. It is
the air-cloud adhering like a summer garment
to the great downs by the sea. I cannot see
the substance of the hills nor their exact curve
along the sky; all I can see is the air that has
thickened and taken to itself form about them.
The atmosphere has collected as the shadow
collects in the distant corner of a room—it is
the shadow of the summer wind. At times it
is so soft, so little more than the air at hand,
that I almost fancy I can look through the solid
boundary. There is no cloud so faint; the great
hills are but a thought at the horizon; I <i>think</i>
them there rather than see them; if I were not
thinking of them, I should scarce know there
was even a haze, with so dainty a hand does
the atmosphere throw its covering over the massy
downs. Riding or passing quickly, perhaps you
would not observe them; but stay among the
heathbells and the sketch appears in the south.
Up from the sea over the cornfields, through the
green boughs of the forest, along the slope,
comes a breath of wind, of honey-sweetened air,
made more delicate by the fanning of a thousand
wings.</p>

<p>The labour of the wind: the cymbals of the
aspen clashing, from the lowest to the highest
bough, each leaf twirling first forwards and then
backwards and swinging to and fro, a double
motion. Each lifts a little and falls back like
a pendulum, twisting on itself; and as it rises
and sinks, strikes its fellow-leaf. Striking the
side of the dark pines, the wind changes their
colour and turns them paler. The oak leaves
slide one over the other, hand above hand,
laying shadow upon shadow on the white road.
In the vast net of the wide elm-tops, the drifting
shadow of the cloud which the wind brings is
caught for a moment. Pushing aside the stiff
ranks of the wheat with both arms, the air reaches
the sun-parched earth. It walks among the
mowing-grass like a farmer feeling the crop with
his hand one side, and opening it with his walking-stick
the other. It rolls the wavelets carelessly
as marbles to the shore; the red cattle redden
the pool and stand in their own colour. The
green caterpillar swings as he spins his thread
and lengthens his cable to the tide of air, descending
from the tree; before he can slip it, the
white throat takes him. With a thrust, the wind
hurls the swallow, or the still grander traverser
of air, the swift, fifty miles faster on his way;
it ruffles back the black velvet of the creepy mole
peeping forth from his burrow. Apple-bloom
and crab-apple bloom have been blown long
since athwart the furrows over the orchard wall;
May petals and June roses scattered; the pollen
and the seeds of the meadow-grasses thrown
on the threshing-floor of mother-earth in basketfuls.
Thistle down and dandelion down, the
brown down of the goat’s-beard; by-and-by the
keys of the sycamores twirling aslant—the wind
carries them all on its back, gossamer web and
great heron’s vanes—the same weight to the wind;
the drops of the waterfall blown aside sprinkle
the bright green ferns. The voice of the cuckoo
in his season travels drowsily on the zephyr, and
the note comes to the most distant hill, and deep
into the deepest wood.</p>

<p>The light and fire of summer are made beautiful
by the air, without whose breath the glorious
summer were all spoiled. Thick are the hawthorn
leaves, many deep on the spray; and
beneath them there is a twisted and intertangled
winding in and out of boughs, such as no curious
ironwork of ancient artist could equal; through
the leaves and metal-work of boughs the soft west
wind wanders at its ease. Wild wasp and tutored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">{499}</span>
bee sing sideways on their course as the breeze
fills their vanes; with broad coloured sails boomed
out, drifts the butterfly alee. Beside a brown-coated
stone in the shadowed stream, a brown
trout watches for the puffs that slay the Mayflies.
Their ephemeral wings were made for a
more exquisite life; they endure but one sun;
they bear not the touch of the water; they die
like a dream dropping into the river. To the amethyst
in the deep ditch the wind comes; no petal
so hidden under green it cannot find; to the
blue hill-flower up by the sky; it lifts the guilty
head of the passionate poppy that has sinned in
the sun for love. Sweet is the rain the wind
brings to the wallflower browned in the heat,
a-dry on the crumbling stone. Pleasant the sunbeams
to the marigold when the wind has carried
the rain away and his sun-disc glows on the
bank. Acres of perfume come on the wind from
the black and white of the bean-field; the firs
fill the air by the copse with perfume. I know
nothing to which the wind has not some happy
use. Is there a grain of dust so small the wind
shall not find it out? Ground in the mill-wheel
of the centuries, the iron of the distant mountain
floats like gossamer, and is drunk up as dew by
leaf and living lung. A thousand miles of cloud
go by from morn till night, passing overhead
without a sound; the immense packs, a mile
square, succeed to each other, side by side, laid
parallel, book-shape, coming up from the horizon
and widening as they approach. From morn till
night the silent footfalls of the ponderous vapours
travel overhead, no sound, no creaking of the
wheels and rattling of the chains; it is calm at
the earth, but the wind labours without an effort
above, with such ease, with such power. Gray
smoke hangs on the hillside where the couch-heaps
are piled, a cumulus of smoke; the wind
comes, and it draws its length along like the
genii from the earthen pot; there leaps up a
great red flame shaking its head; it shines in
the bright sunlight; you can see it across the
valley.</p>

<p>A perfect summer day with a strong south
wind: a cloudless blue sky blown pale, a summer
sun blown cool, deep draughts of refreshing air
to man and horse, clear definition of red-tile roof
and conical oast, perfect colour of soft ash-green
trees. In the evening, fourteen black swifts
rushing together through the upper atmosphere
with shrill cries, sometimes aside and on the
tip of one wing, with a whirl descending, a
black trail, to the tiled ridge they dwell in.
Fine weather after this.</p>

<p>A swooning August day, with a hot east wind,
from which there is no escape, which gives no air
to the chest—you breathe and are not satisfied
with the inspiration; it does not fill; there is
no life in the killed atmosphere. It is a vacuum
of heat, and yet the strong hot wind bends the
trees, and the tall firs wrestle with it as they
did with Sinis, the Pine-bender, bowed down and
rebounding, as if they would whirl their cones
away like a catapult. Masses of air are moving
by, and yet there is none to breathe. No escape
in the shadow of hedge or wood, or in the
darkened room; darkness excludes the heat that
comes with light, but the heat of the oven-wind
cannot be shut out. Some monstrous dragon of
the Chinese sky pants his fiery breath upon
us, and the brown grass stalks threaten to catch
flame in the field. The grain of wheat that was
full of juice dries hard in the ears, and water
is no more good for thirst. There is not a cloud
in the sky; but at night there is heavy rain,
and the flowers are beaten down. There is a
thunder-wind that blows at intervals when great
clouds are visibly gathering over the hayfield. It
is almost a calm; but from time to time a breath
comes, and a low mournful cry sounds in the
hollow farmhouse—the windows and doors are
open, and the men and women have gone out
to make hasty help in the hay ere the storm—a
mournful cry in the hollow house, as unhappy
a note as if it were soaked February.</p>

<p>In April, six miles away in the valley, a vast
cloud came down with swan-shot of hail, black
as blackest smoke, overwhelming house and wood,
all gone and mixed with the sky, and behind
the mass there followed a white cloud sunlit
dragging along the ground, like a cumulus fallen
to the earth. At sunset, the sky cleared, and
under the glowing rim of the sun, a golden wind
drove the host of vapour before it, scattering
it to the right and left. Large pieces caught
and tore themselves in the trees of the forest,
and one curved fragment hurled from the ridge,
fell in the narrow coomb, lit up as it came down
with golden sunset rays, standing out bright
against the shadowed wood. Down it came
slowly, as it were with outstretched arms, loth
to fall, carrying the coloured light of the sky
to the very surface of the earth.</p>

<p class="ph3">BY GRANT ALLEN,<br>
<span class="smcap">Author of ‘Babylon,’ ‘Strange Stories,’ etc. etc.</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Half-way</span> down to the blazing trash-houses, Mr
Dupuy and his little band of black allies, all
armed only with the sticks they had hastily
seized from the stand in the piazza, came on
a sudden face to face with the wild and frantic
mob of half-tipsy rioters. ‘Halt!’ Mr Dupuy
called out in a cool and unmoved tone of command
to the reckless insurgents, as they marched
on in irregular order, brandishing their cutlasses
wildly in the flickering firelight. ‘You black-guards,
what are you doing here, and what
do you mean by firing and burning my trash-houses?’</p>

<p>By the ruddy light of the lurid blaze behind
him, Louis Delgado recognised at once the familiar
face of his dearest enemy. ‘Me fren’s,’ he
shrieked, in a loud outburst of gratified vindictiveness,
‘dis is him—dis is him—dis de buckra
Dupuy we come to kill now! De Lard has delibbered
him into our hands witout so much as gib
us de trouble ob go an’ attack him.’</p>

<p>But before even Delgado could bring down
with savage joy his uplifted weapon on his
hated enemy’s bare head, Mr Dupuy had stepped
boldly and energetically forward, and catching
the wiry African by his outstretched arm, had
cried aloud in his coolest and most deliberate
accents: ‘Louis Delgado, put down your cutlass.
As a magistrate for this island, I arrest you for
riot.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">{500}</span></p>

<p>His resolute boldness was not without its due
effect. For just the swing of a pendulum there
was a profound silence, and that great mob of
strangely beraged and rum-maddened negroes
held its breath irresolutely, doubting in its own
six hundred vacillating souls which of the two
things rather to do—whether to yield as usual
to the accustomed authority of that one bold
and solitary white man, the accredited mouthpiece
of law and order, or else to rush forward madly
and hack him then and there into a thousand
pieces with African ferocity. So instinctive in
the West Indian negro’s nature is the hereditary
respect for European blood, that even though
they had come there for the very purpose of
massacring and mutilating the defenceless buckra,
they stood appalled, now the actual crisis had
fairly arrived, at the bare idea of venturing
to dispute the question openly with the one
lone and unarmed white man.</p>

<p>But Louis Delgado, African born that he was,
had no such lingering West Indian prejudices.
Disengaging his sinewy captive arm from Mr
Dupuy’s flabby grasp with a sudden jerk, he
lifted his cutlass once more high into the air,
and held it, glittering, for the twinkling of an
eye, above the old man’s defenceless head. One
moment, Uncle ’Zekiel saw it gleam fearfully
in the red glare of the burning trash-houses;
the next, it had fallen on Mr Dupuy’s shoulder,
and the blood was spurting out in crimson
splashes over his white tie and open shirt-front,
in which he had risen but a few minutes before
so unsuspectingly from his own dinner-table.</p>

<p>The old planter reeled terribly before the
violent force of that staggering blow, but kept
his face still turned bravely with undiminished
courage toward the exultant enemy. At the
sight of the gushing blood, however—the proud
buckra blood, that shows so visibly on the delicate
white European skin—the negroes behind set
up a loud and horrid peal of unearthly laughter,
and rushed forward, all their hesitation flung
away at once, closing round him in a thickly
packed body, each eager not to lose his own share
in the delightful excitement of hacking him to
pieces. A dozen cutlasses gleamed aloft at once
in the bare black arms, and a dozen more blows
were aimed at the wounded man fiercely by as
many hideous, grinning rioters.</p>

<p>Uncle ’Zekiel and the household negroes,
oblivious and almost unconscious of themselves,
as domestic servants of their race always are in
the presence of danger for their master or his
family, pressed around the reeling white man
in a serried ring, and with their sticks and arms,
a frail barrier, strove manfully to resist the fierce
onslaught of the yelling and leaping plantation
negroes. In spite of what Mr Dupuy had just
been saying about the negroes being all alike
cowards, the petty handful of faithful blacks,
forming a close and firm semicircle in front of
their wounded master, fought like wild beasts at
bay with hands and arms, and legs and teeth,
and sticks and elbows, opposing stoutly, by fair
means and foul, the ever-pressing sea of wild
rioters. As they fought, they kept yielding
slowly but cautiously before the steady pressure;
and Mr Dupuy, reeling and staggering he knew
not how, but with his face kept ever, like a
fighting Dupuy, turned dauntlessly toward the
surging enemy, retreated slowly backward step
by step in the direction of his own piazza.
Just as he reached the bottom of the steps,
Uncle ’Zekiel meanwhile shielding and protecting
him manfully with his portly person, a woman
rushed forth from the mass of the rioters, and
with hideous shrieks of ‘Hallelujah, hallelujah!’
hacked him once more with her blunt cutlass
upon the ribs and body.</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy, faint and feeble from loss of blood,
but still cool and collected as ever, groped his
way ever backward up the steps, in a blind,
reeling, failing fashion, and stood at last at bay
in the doorway of the piazza, with his faithful
bodyguard, wounded and bleeding freely like
himself, still closing resolutely around him.</p>

<p>‘This will do, ’Zekiel,’ he gasped out incoherently,
as he reached the top landing. ‘In the
pass of the doorway. Stop them easily. Fire
rouse the military. Hold the house for half an
hour—help from the governor. Quick, quick!
give me the pistol.’</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a small white hand, delicate
and bloodless, appearing suddenly from the room
behind him, placed his little revolver, cocked
and loaded, between the trembling fingers of his
left hand, for the right lay already hacked and
useless, hanging idly by his side in limp helplessness.</p>

<p>‘Nora, my dear,’ the old man sobbed out in
a half-inarticulate gurgling voice, ‘go back—go
back this moment to the boudoir. Back garden;
slip away quietly—no place for you, Orange
Grove, this evening. Slight trouble with the
plantation blacks. Quell the rioters.—Close up,
’Zekiel.—Close up, Dick, Thomas, Jo, Robert,
Emilius, Mark Antony!’ And with a quivering
hand, standing there alone in the narrow doorway,
while the mob below swarmed and pressed up
the piazza steps in wild confusion, the wounded
planter fired the revolver, with no definite aim,
blank into the surging midst of the mob, and let
his left hand drop as he did so, white and fainting
by his side, with his vain endeavour.</p>

<p>The bullet had hit one of the negro women
full in the thigh, and it only served still further
to madden and enrage the clamouring mob, now
frantically thirsty for the buckra blood.</p>

<p>‘Him wounded Hannah—him wounded Hannah!’
the negroes yelled in their buzzing indignation;
and at the word, they rushed forward
once more with mad gesticulations, those behind
pushing those in front against the weak yielding
wall of Orange Grove servants, and all menacing
horribly with their blood-reddened cutlasses, as
they shrieked aloud frantically: ‘Kill him—kill
him!’</p>

<p>The servants still held firm with undaunted
courage, and rallied bravely round their tottering
master; but the onslaught was now far too
fierce for them, and one by one they were thrust
back helpless by the raging mob, who nevertheless
abstained so far as possible from hurting
any one of them, aiming all their blows directly
at the detested white man himself alone. If by
chance at any moment a cutlass came down unintentionally
upon the broad backs of the negro
defenders, a cry arose at once from the women
in the rear of ‘Doan’t hit him—doan’t hit him.
Him me brudder. Colour for colour! Kill de
buckra! Hallelujah!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">{501}</span></p>

<p>And all this time, Nora Dupuy looked on
from behind, holding her bloodless hands clasped
downward in mute agony, not so much afraid
as expectant, with Aunt Clemmy and the women-servants
holding her and comforting her with
well-meant negro consolation, under the heavy
mahogany arch of the dining-room doorway.</p>

<p>At last, Delgado, standing now on the topmost
step, and half within the area of the piazza,
aimed one terrible slashing cut at the old planter,
as he stood supporting himself feebly by a piece
of the woodwork, and hacked him down, a heavy
mass, upon the ground before them with a wild
African cry of vengeance. The poor old man
fell, insensible, in a little pool of his own blood;
and the Orange Grove negroes, giving way finally
before the irresistible press of their overwhelming
opponents, left him there alone, surrounded
on every side by the frantic mob of enraged
insurgents.</p>

<p>Nora, clasping her hands tighter than ever,
and immovable as a statue, stood there still,
without uttering a cry or speaking a word—as
cold and white and motionless as marble.</p>

<p>‘Hack him to pieces!’ ‘Him doan’t dead yet!’
‘Him only faintin’!’ ‘Burn him—burn him!’
A chorus of cries rose incoherently from the six
hundred lips of the victorious negroes. And
as they shouted, they mangled and mutilated the
old man’s body with their blunt cutlasses in a
way perfectly hideous to look at; the women
especially crowding round to do their best at
kicking and insulting their fallen enemy.</p>

<p>‘Tank de Lard—tank de Lard!’ Delgado, now
drunk with blood, shouted out fiercely to his
frenzied followers. ‘We done killed de ole man.
Now we gwine to kill de missy!’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> old saying which tells us there are ‘tricks
in all trades,’ would appear from recent exposures
and explanations to be almost more applicable
to jewellers than to other traders; and if only
one half of the misdemeanours with which they
are charged be true, they deserve to be placed
in the front rank of trade tricksters. There are,
however, jewellers and jewellers, and although,
happily, as a class they are above suspicion,
yet, as our courts of justice occasionally reveal,
there are also not a few black-sheep in the flock—men
who do not scruple to deal in ‘doublets’
and paste, and who pass off gems and jewels
as genuine, that they know to be either altogether
false, or to possess some hidden flaw
sufficient greatly to lessen their value. Every
now and then we find in the newspapers a
paragraph or longer article concerning ‘mystery
gold,’ ‘forged gems,’ or ‘false jewels.’ Recent
examples of this kind of news have appeared
to the effect that an important discovery had
been made regarding the crown of a foreign
potentate, as well as the diamond necklace of
a lady of rank, many of the gems in the latter
article being made of paste; whilst the diadem
of the king is announced to be little better
than a theatrical bauble, most of the real stones
having been extracted and their places filled with
imitation ones. Another announcement of the
kind calls attention to the fact of several imitation
stones having been found in a jewelled collar
hitherto supposed to be of very great value, and
which had been sold by an illustrious person
in ignorance of the fact.</p>

<p>‘What <i>is</i> paste?’ asked a London magistrate,
in the course of his examination into a charge
of selling imitation stones for real ones. ‘Paste,
sir,’ replied the witness, ‘means a mixture of violin
glass and borax;’ from which, as we have been
informed, the closest imitations of diamonds and
other precious stones can be made (see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66579/66579-h/66579-h.htm#ARTIFICIAL_JEWELS">‘Artificial
Jewels,’ <i>Chambers’s Journal</i>, Nov. 15, 1884</a>). Visitors
to Paris who have feasted their eyes on the made-up
gems so lavishly displayed in the jewellers’
windows of the Rue de la Paix and the Palais-Royal,
feel surprised when they are told that
four-fifths of the glittering baubles are composed
of paste, and are of little value as compared
with real gems. It used to be said that most of
the jewelry shown in the Palais-Royal was manufactured
for use on the stage; but the actresses
of to-day, unless obliged to wear paste, will, when
they can afford it, adorn their persons with none
but real gems. The names of several artists
might easily be given who are reputed to be passing
rich in diamonds and rubies, and who are
possessed besides of pearls of great price. Some
actresses, indeed, seem to draw audiences nowadays
as much by the aid of their jewels as their
talents. When a female star visits the provinces,
pains are frequently taken to proclaim the number
and value of her gems and jewels. Who,
then, wears the paste diamonds and other imitation
gems which are manufactured? To this
question, an answer of rather a startling kind
has more than once been given, and one of the
latest may here be noted. A gentleman who was
deeply involved in the pursuits of the turf requiring
a considerable sum of money to pay his debts
of honour, stole his wife’s jewels in order to pawn
them. To his consternation, the pawnbroker
refused to look at them. ‘Why?’ was feverishly
asked. ‘Because they are paste.’—‘Paste! My
wife’s jewels paste?’—‘Yes. I supplied her with
them. The originals are in my safe; I advanced
thirteen hundred pounds upon them.’ Unfortunately,
the gentleman’s wife was as great a
gambler as her husband, and she had been obliged
to pawn her diamonds to meet her own liabilities.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of persons who ‘get up’ precious
stones and mock-pearls for ‘the trade’ has been
often commented upon and frequently censured.
A London lapidary who works in the groove
indicated was called upon, a few months ago, in
a court of law to explain his mode of procedure.
‘I make all my imitations out of real stones,’
was his reply to the judge. On being asked
to be more explicit, he said: ‘Perhaps I possess
some pale stones which are of small value:
these I split by the aid of my tools; then introducing
a deeper tone of colour, I join them
together again, having considerably increased their
saleable value.’ In this manner the colours of
many stones are said to be intensified, such as
emeralds, sapphires, amethysts, and others. Diamonds
are constantly utilised by being split, each
half of a gem perhaps doing duty on a paste foundation
on which it has been carefully mounted.
A stone which may be of the value of ten pounds
having been split at little cost, is carefully
mounted, and becomes transformed into two gems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">{502}</span>
each affirmed to be worth that sum. It requires
a clever expert to detect such frauds when they
are cleverly executed, or to discover that the ‘fire’
imparted to certain stones that would otherwise
be dull of hue and greatly deficient in sparkle,
is conferred by so simple an expedient as a backing
of tinfoil.</p>

<p>The invention of what are called ‘doublets’
in diamond-dealing can be traced back for centuries.
One mode of getting up false stones
has been described by Jerome Cardan, who has
published in detail the method of the inventor,
one Zocolino. This person’s way of working was
to procure a thin flake of a very inferior and
cheap example of the stone he desired to ‘improve,’
choosing those which had little colour, and might
in consequence be procured at a nominal price.
As a bottom for his ‘make-up’ he took a bit
of crystal which he had shaped to his purpose;
covering this with a transparent glue with which
he had mixed the necessary colouring material,
so as to be like the finest specimen of the gem
he intended to forge, he carefully fixed on the
flake of stone, and concealed the joining of the
two so deftly by careful setting as to make
purchasers fancy that his gems were not only
genuine, but really finer than those of other
jewellers. For a time Zocolino flourished, and
was enabled by means of his cunning workmanship
to deceive the cleverest lapidaries; but
detection came at last, and put an end to his
fraudulent practices in gem-making.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned as a warning to travellers
that the Singhalese at Colombo are experts in
such frauds, and frequently persuade persons to
purchase cleverly set up doublets, or pieces of
rock-crystal cut and polished. Doublets in many
cases, especially when both parts are really
diamonds, are somewhat difficult to detect even
by men who have had great experience in the
gem and jewel trades. Before leaving the diamond,
we may mention another kind of fraud
connected with it. Often, when these gems have
been set in a cluster, it has been found on
examination that at least one of the stones is
made of paste, or is perhaps a doublet. A rather
curious story went the round of the press some
years ago, when, on the death of a lady of title,
it was found that more than one-third of the
family diamonds were composed of false stones.
These imitations had been so beautifully executed
that none but the cleverest dealers were able to
detect them; while in the case of some of the
stones, it was not till their specific gravity had
been tested that a decision could be arrived at.
It has been found on examination, we believe,
that necklaces of so-called real diamonds have
often contained twenty per cent. of doublets or
other stones of questionable quality. Respectable
dealers in jewelry maintain that it is the public
who are to blame for the production of false
jewels, knowing well enough that genuine gems
could not be given at the prices offered for them.
Retail jewellers are not seldom deceived themselves,
not being, perhaps, so well versed in the
technical knowledge incidental to their trade as
they ought to be. Tradesmen of repute, however,
are exceedingly careful in their selection of stock,
no gem being offered for sale unless it is known
to be genuine.</p>

<p>Many gems are really gems of a kind, although
not the gems they are pretended to be, but in
all probability are composed of pieces of quartz
‘got up’ for the market, quartz being selected
as being able to stand the test of the file, which
glass cannot do. There are varieties of topaz
and other stones which are as hard as the diamond;
and being entirely colourless, they are
often cut and polished and successfully palmed
off as diamonds. This colourless gem material
is costly in consequence of the use to which it
can be turned. Recipes for the production of
imitation stones have been often given; the
following is the formula for a ruby: five hundred
parts of strass, twenty of glass of antimony, a
half each of purple of Cassius and of gold. Strass
is a specially manufactured kind of glass which
has been long used in connection with the fabrication
of gems; it usually contains a much larger
percentage of oxide of lead than the commoner
sorts of glass. Aventurine is another kind of
gem glass, which is chiefly manufactured in
Venice, and brings a high price. The best thing
is a quartz of varying shades of colour, which
is much prized. One of the scarcer varieties is
known as sunstone, and is much sought after,
being valuable for such purposes as have been
referred to.</p>

<p>Attempts by chemists to produce diamonds
have, commercially speaking, usually resulted in
failure. The most successful of the early experiments
tried in the way of diamond production
was that worked out by Gannal, a Frenchman,
who in the year 1828 succeeded in producing
a substance that was affirmed by a practical
jeweller of great repute to be a diamond; but
after much controversy, the opinion came to be
ultimately entertained that even Gannal had
failed. Another famous Frenchman, M. Desprets,
made several endeavours in the same direction
with partial success; he produced matter at all
events with which it was found to be possible
to cut and polish the harder gems. A Monsieur
de Chaud Courtois has also entered upon various
experiments with a view to the production of
‘real’ diamonds, but, so far as we know, without
having achieved success. Mr MacTier’s experiments
at the St Rollox chemical works in Glasgow
have been so recently discussed as not to require
farther reference.</p>

<p>The so-called ‘Scottish Jewelry,’ made from
cairngorms, cinnamon stone, &amp;c., is largely manufactured
in Germany, where most of the stones
required are quite plentiful. It is common
enough to impose the cairngorm on ignorant
purchasers as Brazilian or Mexican topaz. Edinburgh
lapidaries are able to prepare and mount
the cairngorm and pebbles of Scotland with taste
and skill. Crystals of smoky quartz are found
in every part of the globe, and can be so skilfully
dealt with by lapidaries and experts as to be
made deeper or lighter in colour as may be
demanded. Each manipulator is of course careful
to preserve his particular mode of procedure secret
from his fellows; and some of them are very
clever in their various manipulations of Scottish
stones, which can be set with fine effect in
brooches, snuff-mulls, dirks, and powder-horns.</p>

<p>‘Mock-pearls’ are the subject of frequent discussion.
The wonderful lustre and exquisite
polish of the real gem of the sea have been more
than once imitated with almost the power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">{503}</span>
nature. But there is a something about this
beautiful and mysterious production which in
the end tells against all attempts at fraud. The
imitation when tested with the real gem provides
one source of detection, and the brittle nature of
the manufactured article is another. Another
matter is that the exquisitely drilled holes which
are characteristic of the pearls of the East are
wanting in all imitations, the drilling in the
latter case being usually clumsy and blunt-edged.
The scales of a small fish known as the <i>bleak</i> have
been successfully used in the formation of false
pearls; but as it requires some eighteen thousand
of these fish to provide one pound-weight of the
pearl-making material, it seems superfluous to say
that only a very limited number of gems can be
made from the scales of the bleak.</p>

<p>Here we pause, not having space left in which
to discuss the ‘manufacture’ of cameos, or the
production of that ‘mystery gold’ which two
years ago afforded so much material for newspaper
discussion. At the present time, when pictures
and pottery, old furniture, articles of virtu of all
kinds, coins, and even birds’ eggs, are forged, it
is not a matter for surprise that spurious diamonds,
mock-pearls, and imitations of many of
our more precious gems should be foisted on
the public by unscrupulous tradespeople. Nevertheless,
so long as a lady can purchase for a few
pounds a necklace or other adornment which,
if genuine, would have cost hundreds or perhaps
thousands of pounds, the imitation gem trade
will continue to flourish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.—THE MAJOR’S PREDICAMENT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> his enemies admitted that Major Dawkins
was one of the kindliest-natured of men. If
anybody was in a difficulty, he would take infinite
pains to help him or her out of it—provided
the difficulty was not financial. In that case he
had all the will, but not the means to assist
otherwise than with good advice; and the fact
was so well known, that nobody ever thought
of borrowing from him. Most of his friends
were in comfortable circumstances, and therefore
above the need of troubling him about pecuniary
matters. But his happiness in having wealthy
friends was owing to his good luck; certainly
not to any careful selection on his part, for he
was such a chatty, pleasant little man, so frank
and easy in his ways, that he picked up acquaintances
everywhere. In a train or on a steamer,
he would be in five minutes conversing with his
immediate fellow-passengers; in half an hour,
they would be discussing subjects of personal
interest; and in an hour, they would be talking
and laughing together as if they had been
intimate for years.</p>

<p>He had sympathy enough to comprehend all
beings and all things. He mourned with those
who were mourning; he rejoiced with those
who were rejoicing. One day he would be at
a funeral with visage as lugubrious as his garb;
and the day following he would be at a wedding,
the gayest of the gay, ready with pretty speeches
for the bride, the most flattering prophecies for
the bridesmaids, and the heartiest congratulations
for the bridegroom on the fortune which had
given him what Solomon had declared to be the
greatest blessing on earth—a good wife.</p>

<p>The Major was perfectly sincere in his sympathetic
sorrow and in his sympathetic joy; consequently,
he was a favourite with both sexes,
old and young, and was the confidant of all in
many delicate affairs which could have been
intrusted only to one who had proved himself
able to keep a secret as well as to sympathise.
His little foibles were overlooked, or, at most,
provoked a quiet smile at his innocent faith in
their invisibility. For instance, nobody ever displayed
the slightest consciousness that his well-trimmed
black hair and moustache were dyed,
although the fact was patent to every one. On
this subject the Major was peculiarly sensitive;
and for years he cherished the fond delusion that
even his man Hollis believed black to be the
natural colour of his hair. But accident betrayed
the mystery, and from that hour the master was
held in bondage by the man.</p>

<p>Hollis had been in several good places at one
time as valet, and subsequently as butler. As
a matter of principle, he considered himself bound
to test the quality of all the liquors in his
master’s cellar and sideboard; and he had carried
this principle of self-sacrifice to his employers’
interests to such a degree that he was at length
glad to accept the moderate salary which Major
Dawkins could afford to pay him for his services
as general factotum. Of course, Hollis regarded
his new position as a downfall in the world,
for here he had to combine the duties of butler,
valet, and footman, and there was no cellar at
all! But he had a considerate master, and during
their frequent stay at country-houses, Hollis’s
appetites were amply satisfied, whilst he discovered
various ways of securing ‘tips’ which
materially added to his income. He might have
been as contented as a man of his character
ever could be, if it had not been for one
grievance.</p>

<p>His master had a nice little box covered with
Russian leather and supplied with a Bramah
lock. The Major took this box everywhere with
him; he always opened it and locked it himself
and kept the key in his own pocket. It was
not a jewel-case or a cash-box, for Hollis had
seen it open on several occasions, and noted that
its chief contents were a small green glass and
a bottle of peculiar shape without any label.
The principle which regulated the life of Hollis
was touched: he had no doubt that the bottle
contained some special liqueur—in colour it somewhat
resembled yellow Chartreuse, as far as he
could make out—and he felt much aggrieved
that his master would allow him no opportunity
of testing its quality. That it must be something
very special was evident from the care
with which it was guarded.</p>

<p>He watched and waited, and his opportunity
came, as it comes to all who wait. The Major
was out later than usual one night, and next
morning he rose late, which caused him to be
much hurried with his toilet, in order to keep
an important engagement.</p>

<p>‘Back about three,’ he said as he hastened
away.</p>

<p>When the door closed behind him, Hollis, as
was his custom, instantly entered his master’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">{504}</span>
room.—Did his eyes deceive him? No; the key
was in the lock of the little Russian leather case,
for once forgotten by its keeper. The man’s eyes
glistened with satisfaction, and his mouth watered
in anticipation of the treat in store for him, as
he removed the stopper and filled the dainty
glass with the contents of the bottle. It looked
nice, but he did not quite relish its faint odour.
There was a suspicion of almonds and something
else, which he could not liken to anything he
had smelt before. Doubtless it was some Indian
liqueur, good for the liver; people did drink
strange stuffs as well as eat strange stuffs in
foreign parts. Hollis was not the person to
shrink from his duty; he had tasted almost
everything in the way of wines and liqueurs,
and he was bound to discover the character of
this fluid. He raised the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Good heavens! man, what are you doing?’
shouted the voice of the Major, raised in extreme
alarm. ‘That is deadly poison—it is hair-dye!’</p>

<p>The glass dropped from the servant’s trembling
hand, and he stood abashed.</p>

<p>The Major having discovered his oversight
when only a little way from his chambers, had
hastily returned, and his latchkey admitted him.
Without heeding the broken glass, he angrily
locked the case and put the key in his pocket.
He was chagrined that in his excitement he had
blurted out the carefully guarded secret of the
black hair and moustaches; whilst he was relieved
by the thought that he had been in time to save
the man from the consequences of his folly. He
was as much confused as Hollis, and his confusion
lasted longer, for the worthy factotum
was quick to perceive the advantage he had
gained.</p>

<p>Instant dismissal was the penalty that the
master first thought of; and the next moment
he felt that he dared not inflict it. The man
would talk, and in a few hours the scandal
would fly up the back-stairs of every house in
town. Very likely there would be a smart
paragraph in the ‘Society’ journals making fun
of him.</p>

<p>‘Dawkins dyes his hair!’ everybody would be
saying. ‘Could you have believed it?’</p>

<p>The poor little Major shuddered at the bare
thought of the ridicule which would ensue.</p>

<p>‘I’ll look over this, Hollis,’ he said, drawing
up his stiff military collar, in order to appear
more dignified and to render his words more
impressive. ‘You ought to be thankful for that;
but understand, if you try anything like this
again, or if any hint of this morning’s business
reaches my ears, you go. You understand?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. Thank you.’</p>

<p>‘Very well. We start for Todhurst Grange
to-morrow. Get my things ready to-day.’</p>

<p>Hollis bowed and retired without attempting
explanation or apology.</p>

<p>The Major was much perturbed as he drove
along the crowded streets to keep the appointment,
for which he was now a quarter of an
hour late. That was disturbing enough to a
man of his punctual habits; but it was not the
main cause of his present vexation. The main
cause was his sense that from this day forth he
was, metaphorically, under his servant’s thumb.</p>

<p>Observing Dawkins approach for the first time,
you would have fancied that he was a youth of
about twenty-five, although he was several years
more than double that age. His slim figure,
below the average height, was always arrayed
in the latest style affected by young men about
town. There were a few decorous modifications,
certainly, but they were so slight as to be scarcely
observable. Then there was a vivacity about his
movements which only occasionally suggested a
degree of stiffening about the knee-joints, and
thus an appearance of juvenility was produced
until he was subjected to close inspection. The
wrinkles on his brow and under the gray eyes,
and the yellow complexion resulting from the
touch of liver which he had brought home
with him from India, set a stranger speculating
whether he was a prematurely aged boy or
a very vain old man. But as soon as he began
to speak, all speculation on the subject ceased—he
was so young in thought, so interested in
everything he saw and in every one he met.</p>

<p>The fact was that the Major had not yet
realised the truth that he was a grown man and
had passed the equator of middle age. He had
never been married; he had never suffered under
any absorbing attachment to maid or widow; and
although he had been twenty years in the army,
he had never been in action. A petty riot was
the only approach to a battle in which he had
ever been privileged to take part. Whilst he
bore his disappointment cheerfully, as a general
rule, there were times when he lamented the
ill luck which had attended him so far as war
was concerned. His soul had been always eager
for the fray; but fate had denied him any opportunity
to distinguish himself on the field. During
his twenty years of service in India, there
had been battles enough fought and won; but
he had no share in any of them. To satisfy his
ambition, he had twice exchanged into regiments
which were under orders for active service. In
the first instance, the orders were countermanded;
and in the second—the war was over before his
regiment reached the front. So he was gazetted
Major, and was ‘retired’ on half-pay without
having sustained a scratch in his country’s cause,
and without any experience of the proud pomp
and circumstance of the big war that makes
ambition glorious. He lived in hope, however,
that a time would come when the offer of his
sword might be acceptable to the War Office.
He was then a rabid Jingo, and a resolute advocate
of armed opposition to every step made by
Russia in the direction of our Indian empire.
But he kept these sentiments very much to
himself, and only ventilated them when much
provoked by some peace-at-any-price man.</p>

<p>The Major’s cab rushed along the Strand, along
Fleet Street, and up Ludgate Hill, and stopped
in Godlenian Street, one of the dingy, narrow
thoroughfares which represent the wealth of England.
He ascended two flights of dark and well-worn
staircases, stopping at a door on the glass
portion of which was printed the legend, M.
Willis &amp; Co. Entering the office, he was at
once shown into the room with the principal,
who started to his feet to welcome him with a
hearty shake of the hand, although he looked
as if his mind were very much disturbed.</p>

<p>‘It is very good of you to come so promptly,
Major,’ he said earnestly, and at the same time
endeavouring to assume a careless manner; ‘but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">{505}</span>
I know that you have a regard for the Elliotts,
and I am compelled to ask you to help them
out of a confounded mess.’</p>

<p>‘The Elliotts in a mess!’ exclaimed Major
Dawkins in amazement. ‘Which of them do you
mean, the Elliotts of Todhurst or of Arrowby?’</p>

<p>‘Arrowby, of course,’ replied Willis, with an
undercurrent of irritation. ‘They are staying
at Todhurst just now, and Nellie and Stanley
Maynard are there too. You know what a fool
my sister’s husband John Elliott is, and he has
worked himself up into a fit of the most ridiculous
jealousy about Maynard and my sister. He
is so wild about it that he spoke to me, and
wanted me to interfere. I won’t, for he is a—— Well,
I was going to make use of a strong expression;
but you can put it down on your own
account.’</p>

<p>‘He must have been making fun of you,’
returned the Major. ‘He knows that Maynard
is engaged to Nellie.’</p>

<p>‘There was no fun at all about it. The fellow
was as serious as a man could be. I laughed
at him, and tried to reason with him; but it was
no use, as you can understand. I should have
left the thing to be settled between themselves—for
I know Sophy can take care of herself—but
he hinted something about having a detective to
watch her; and you can guess what a general
upset that might mean.’</p>

<p>‘The man must be mad.’</p>

<p>‘That is my opinion—at least, if he is not
mad, he is on the borders of madness. I shouldn’t
mind a bit if he himself were to suffer the consequences
of this nonsense; but, you see, my
sister Nellie and Maynard are all likely to get
into trouble through his insanity. Will you help
them out of it?—I can’t. If I say or do anything,
it will be misunderstood.’</p>

<p>The Major was silent for a moment. He
wished to serve his friends, and yet he was afraid
that he, too, might be misunderstood. But he
had such a sincere regard for the Elliotts, that
he bravely resolved to do what he could to bring
about an amicable arrangement.</p>

<p>‘I wish you had agreed to do it yourself,’
he said reflectively; ‘but as matters stand, perhaps
it will be better for me to do it. I shall
write at once to your sister—Mrs John—to her
husband, and to Nellie. Then I shall get down
to Todhurst as quick as possible; and I have no
doubt that a few words of explanation will set
everything right.’</p>

<p>The Major went to his club, and hurriedly wrote
several letters. But whilst he was placing them
in the envelopes, he was in deep perplexity, for
who could tell what might be the result of this
correspondence?</p>

<p>The result of the important engagement to
which the Major hastened after the scene with
his servant was of a most distressing nature.
The happiness of friends whom he regarded with
profound esteem was in peril, and he had been
told that the catastrophe could only be averted
by his immediate interference. The information
and the intimation were so astounding that he
was bewildered. What could he do? How could
he find the opportunity, or rather how could he
find a sufficiently delicate method of saving those
friends from the folly to which they were being
hastened by misunderstanding and passion?</p>

<p>The friends referred to were Joseph Elliott, J.P.
of Todhurst, to whose place the Major was to
proceed on the following day; and the cousin of
that gentleman, John Elliott, of Arrowby. The
conduct of the latter threatened a domestic
imbroglio, in which an outsider’s interference
was more likely to do mischief than render service.
The whole trouble sprang from a foolish
misunderstanding, which a sentence of explanation
would set right. It seemed very hard to
have the power of speaking that sentence, and
to remain silent out of selfish considerations of
prudence. Nay, was it not wicked to stand by
and see the whole fabric of domestic bliss fall
into ruins, when by simply giving a timely halloo
the calamity might be prevented?</p>

<p>Still, the matter was so delicate that the Major
wisely hesitated to meddle with it, although
appealed to by the near relative of the two
families. Then came the upbraiding question:
‘Was he not a friend of the family, respected by
them all, and having no interest one way or
another, except to do a generous act of service to
people who had temporarily lost control of their
tempers and judgment?’ Yes, he was a friend
of the family, the Major admitted with something
like a sigh, and there was no doubt it
was his duty to open their eyes, and he must
do it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was a merry party on the large bowling-green
of Todhurst Grange playing at lawn-tennis
in the sunshine of the autumn afternoon. The
players had no intention of making a business
of the game by too strict adherence to rules.
Blunders were not regarded by this blithe party
as serious offences, but were laughed at, and
explained to the inexperienced. The young folk
of both sexes were particular in regard to correct
costume, but beyond that they had come out to
amuse themselves, to display their graces, to
laugh, to flirt—or it might be to make love—but
not to strive for any prize except the amusement
of each other.</p>

<p>The Major had taken his place amongst the
young people, and in his light kerseymeres looked
as youthful as his competitors. He was the
worst player on the ground, and in that respect
distinguished himself by affording the greatest
degree of enjoyment to the company. He was
perfectly aware of his own incapacity; but,
cheerfully declaring that it was never too late
to learn, he laughed cordially with those who
laughed at him. He, undoubtedly, would have
been less buoyant had he been aware that much
of the mirth he provoked was due to the droll
effect of his earnest efforts to skip hither and
thither with the same lightness and ease as his
youthful rivals. Of this he was happily unconscious,
and so he flourished his racket gaily,
and began to think that he would soon be a
first-class player. He skipped the more when
he observed that Miss Euphemia Panton, the
wealthy spinster, was watching his movements
from the terrace.</p>

<p>He had made what was, for him, a most
dexterous stroke, and stood complacently waiting
his turn to play, when a servant approached
him and presented a note.</p>

<p>‘Beg pardon, sir, but I was told to ask your
immediate attention to this.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">{506}</span></p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said the Major, putting the note
carelessly in his pocket, as he stood smiling on
his pretty partner, Miss Helen (in home circles,
Nellie) Carroll, who was understood to be engaged
to the stalwart young fellow on the other side
of the net, and at present her opponent.</p>

<p>The Major admired the clever competition of
the lovers; they were so gay and energetic in
it, that his mental reflection was that they were
really trying the question as to which should
be master in the future.</p>

<p>‘I was told to wait an answer, sir,’ was the
respectful reminder of the attendant who had
brought the note.</p>

<p>‘In a minute,’ replied the Major, as he made
one of his funny stiff-kneed skips to meet the
ball which came flying in his direction. He
managed to catch it on the hop, and sent it
far beyond bounds, the feat eliciting loud shouts
of applauding laughter. The hero was complacent:
he had evidently done something—he
did not know what, but it allowed him another
pause. So he looked at the note, and the racket
dropped from his hand. The deep lines of his
visage, which had almost disappeared in his
boyish enjoyment of the game, became suddenly
prominent in the expression of alarm which
took the place of smiles.</p>

<p>‘Gracious powers! I have put the letters into
the wrong envelopes!’</p>

<p>He looked with anxious inquiry into the bright
flushed face of Miss Carroll. No, she had heard
nothing yet. He begged that she would excuse
him, as he was obliged to hasten up to the
house—a message of importance had come for
him, and he had no alternative but to curtail
the happy privilege of being her partner during
the rest of the game. Then, to the attendant:
‘Tell Mrs Elliott I shall be with her immediately.
Hurry, like a good fellow.’</p>

<p>The man bowed and departed. The Major
wiped his brow as he followed, at first with
quick steps, but soon more slowly. He was
trying to collect his thoughts, and to comprehend
the possibilities of the dilemma into which
he had fallen.</p>

<p>‘She must have got the letter intended for
Mrs John; and in that case, what has become of
the others? This <i>is</i> a mess. The thing seemed
to be so easy to settle: only a little explanation
required, and all would have gone smoothly
as ever; and now—who knows what mischief
may come of my idiotic bungling!’</p>

<p>He had never before found himself in such
a desperate position; but he promptly resolved
to take the straight way out of it. He would
at once explain his mistake, ask forgiveness, and
trust to Mrs Joseph Elliott’s good sense and
good-nature to keep her silent about the matter
which had been accidentally revealed to her.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he entered Mrs Joseph’s boudoir
with a dejected air, but with the firm step of
one resolved to do his duty at any cost. He
found the lady standing by her writing-table, with
cheeks flushed and eyes uncomfortably bright
with excitement. She held an open letter in
her hand. She was a plump, fair woman, with
soft pretty features, and rather small gray eyes.
She was easy-going and good-tempered to a
degree, because she had a supreme dislike to
be bothered about anything; but, like these easy-going
people in general, once she was roused,
she held obstinately to the idea which possessed
her, and would not be convinced by any argument
that a mistake had been made and that
indignation was uncalled for.</p>

<p>‘I regret having been obliged to call you
away from your amusement, Major Dawkins,’
she said, controlling her voice with an evident
effort; ‘but here is a letter of a most extraordinary
nature, which has apparently reached
my hands without being intended for them. If
I am not very much mistaken, I believe <i>you</i>
can give me some explanation of its contents.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mrs Elliott,’ the Major answered
nervously, ‘I gathered from the note I received
on the lawn that some blunder had been made.
Allow me to assure you’——</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think it would be as well if you
looked at the letter before you proceed further?’
was Mrs Joseph’s cold interruption. ‘I wish to
know if this was written by you; and if it was,
I shall understand how to proceed.’</p>

<p>The Major held out his hand for the letter;
but Mrs Joseph laid it on her desk and held
it down, as if unwilling to trust it out of her
hand. He glanced at the paper and groaned.
It was not necessary to read more than the first
words. As he had expected, the letters had
somehow got into the wrong envelopes.</p>

<p>‘Yes, this was written by me, but it was not
intended for you.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ she exclaimed with a slight
hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>‘I really do wish you would allow me to
explain: there is a mistake—a cruel blunder’——</p>

<p>‘I shall seek my husband and ask <i>him</i> to
explain.’</p>

<p>‘For heaven’s sake, don’t. He has nothing
whatever to do with it. If you would allow
me’——</p>

<p>‘But I shall not allow you, Major Dawkins,
to say another word. You, having made this
mistake, wish to screen your friend. But that
will not do for me. Whatever you may have
to say must be spoken in his presence.’</p>

<p>‘If you would only allow me’——</p>

<p>She bowed contemptuously, and passed out of
the room, leaving the Major standing with eyes
and mouth wide open in hopeless bewilderment.
He clasped his brow, stared at the door and at the
desk where the letter had lain.</p>

<p>‘Why did I not snatch it from the foolish
woman, and so compel her to hear me? What
mischief have I done! I must get those letters
back at any cost. I must see both the Elliotts
and explain. They must understand—they must
excuse me, for they know my eagerness to serve
them. I must get hold of Joe before she sees
him.’ And he hurried away in search of his
host.</p>

<p>The letter which caused so much commotion
contained nothing more terrible than this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>—Let me implore you to
act with more consideration towards Mrs E.
The incident which vexes you is capable of
the simplest explanation; and if you persist in
your present unreasonable suspicions, there is
no saying what havoc you may make of your
own and other people’s happiness. I understand
the whole position, and will be glad to set things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">{507}</span>
right—as I believe it is now in my power to
do as soon as we meet, if you will only confide
in me.—Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. Dawkins</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter had been intended for Mr John
Elliott, a morbidly nervous and suspicious man,
and it had been placed in an envelope addressed
to Mrs J. Elliott, Todhurst. Such a blunder
was most irritating; but after all, it could be
explained, and the good-nature which had
prompted his action could not be understood.</p>

<p>He had himself received a letter intended for
another fellow, although bearing his (the Major’s)
address in full on the envelope. He had even
received an epistle from a man of education and
intelligence, in which the writer, instead of
putting down his own signature, had written
the name of the addressee. It was not such a
very uncommon blunder for a person who was
sending off a number of missives in a hurry.
The salve of these reflections afforded only
momentary relief to the poor Major’s disturbed
conscience. The instances of blunders such as
he had perpetrated had occurred on trivial
occasions, and afforded merriment to all parties
when discovered. But in his own case, the
happiness of half-a-dozen people was involved,
and he was stung by remorse for his carelessness,
whilst feeling that he was walking in a
dense fog of confusion.</p>

<p>As the Major was rushing in the direction of
the stables, in the neighbourhood of which he was
most likely to find his horse-loving host at that
time of day, he was pounced upon by a troop
of young Elliotts. He was a special favourite
with the young folk—for who so young as he
when amongst them? He was saluted with a
chorus of invitations to different games; and it
was a little time before he could impress upon
them the fact that he could not join them, as
he had very serious business with their father.
Where was he?</p>

<p>He was half-deafened by the variety of
responses, all spoken simultaneously: ‘I saw
him near the duck-pond; come along, Major.’—‘He’s
in the orchard’—‘He’s looking at the
new mare in the meadow’—‘He’s giving physic
to <i>Tally-ho</i> in the stable.’</p>

<p>In desperation, the Major pranced off at
random. There was a brief pause among the
young folk; then, struck by the idea that their
friend was only making fun after all, they
gave the view-halloo and followed in full chase,
girls and boys competing to be first to run
down the quarry. The Major in his gay tennis
suit, now somewhat disarranged, panting and
flushed, followed by the merry troop, was like
a big schoolboy playing at Hare and Hounds—the
hare getting very much the worst of it.</p>

<p>‘Major Dawkins—Major Dawkins!’ called a
lady who was standing in his path as he
approached her. ‘Do, please, stop playing with
the children; I want to speak to you.’</p>

<p>It was Mrs John Elliott of Arrowby.</p>

<p>The Major, even if politeness had not compelled
him to obey, was very glad to halt. He could
not have run much farther. The children were
around him in a moment, clinging to his sleeves,
and laughing in gleeful triumph.</p>

<p>‘My dears,’ said the Major, gasping for breath,
‘I really am in earnest. I do want you to let
me off to-day.’</p>

<p>‘And I have something particular to say to
the Major,’ added Mrs John, as she took the
gentleman’s arm and led him away from the
disappointed group.</p>

<p>Mrs John was a lady endowed with the
blissful nature which without effort can under
any circumstances realise the spirit of the old
saw—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She seemed to be always laughing; she was as
fond of bonbons as a child; and although
turned thirty, she was still one of those ‘giddy
young things’ who quite innocently find great
satisfaction in attracting the attention of men’s
eyes. She did not try to do this by extravagance
of dress, although it obtained special
care. Indeed, she did not try at all; but her
blithe, frank ways magnetised men, and she was
alike to all, old or young, handsome or otherwise.
It had, therefore, caused much amazement
that she should have given her hand to
John Elliott. Had she mated with his cousin
Joseph, the burly, jovial, red-haired, fox-hunting
squire of Todhurst, the fitness of things would
have been appreciated. But John!—it was incomprehensible.</p>

<p>He was the antithesis of his cousin: bilious,
sallow, narrow-chested, and with stooping shoulders.
He had no interest in field-sports; he
did not keep more than ten acres of his land
under his own management; but he was strict
with his agent and tenants about rents. He
was a dilettante archæologist, a dilettante book-hunter,
and a dilettante philanthropist. He
believed that he was in earnest. He regarded
his wife as a jewel so precious that every one
envied him the possession; and when he came
to understand that people wondered why she
had married <i>him</i>, he began to wonder too, and
the result was much mental torture. He was
conscious that she might have had a much more
suitable mate, and that consciousness rendered
him the more jealously fond. She, although at
moments incensed at his folly and want of faith,
maintained her good spirits and retained her
good looks.</p>

<p>‘Now, Major,’ she said in her sprightly way,
as soon as they had got beyond earshot of the
children, ‘I want you to tell me all about this
mysterious note you have sent me. I can guess
that you mean my husband by “our mutual
friend.” But who is the “lady,” and what is
the nonsense to which you ask me to pay no
heed?’</p>

<p>The Major absolutely groaned inwardly; for
he knew by her allusions that his worst fears
were realised, and she had got the note intended
for Nellie. So, then, each of the three letters
had been delivered to the wrong person! Confound
that hurry—confound that fellow Hollis,
who had been the cause of it by his mischievous
interference with the hair-dye. Had it not been
for that incident, the Major was convinced he
could never have made such a gross mistake
as this. And here was the happiness of a
household imperilled by a bottle of hair-dye!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">{508}</span></p>

<p>‘It may be monstrously absurd to others,’
groaned the miserable Dawkins; ‘but to me it
is monstrously distressing.’</p>

<p>‘What is so absurd and at the same time so
distressing?’ inquired Mrs John gaily, restraining
within due bounds her inclination to laugh at
the extraordinary contortions of his features.</p>

<p>‘My dear madam, I assure you, it is all a
stupid and most lamentable mistake on my part.
That letter’——</p>

<p>‘I am quite satisfied that it is a mistake,’
she interrupted. ‘Pray, do not feel any uneasiness
on that account, and do not bother about the
letter. But, concerning the lady, I should like
to know something, and you promise here to
tell me.’ She held the unlucky letter open in
her hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,’ it ran—‘That is the most
appropriate form of address for me to use on
the present occasion, which is in my eyes an
important one. I beseech you to give no heed
whatever to any nonsense you may hear about
our “mutual friend” and a certain lady. There
is not the slightest foundation for it, and of that
I shall convince you immediately after my arrival
at Todhurst.—Believe me, your most faithful
servant,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Alfred Dawkins</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>‘You were never intended to receive that letter,’
ejaculated the Major with a resolute effort to
pull himself together.</p>

<p>‘I am sure my husband did not intend it,’
she rejoined, smiling confidentially; ‘but I thank
you for putting me on my guard against idle
rumours. It was your duty to do so, as the
friend of the family, and I for one am grateful.
But it was scarcely necessary; for although John
is peculiar in some ways, I have perfect confidence
in his discretion, and know that he is
incapable of entangling himself with any lady,
except through others misunderstanding one of
his philanthropic crazes.—Ah, I see what it is,’
and here her expression changed from that of
half-indifferent curiosity to one of serious interest.
‘He has been kind to some wretched creature,
and she is trying to take advantage of him.
That is what you mean by warning me not to
heed any nonsense I might hear. Thanks, thanks!
I must go at once and relieve his mind of any
uneasiness as to my views of the case.’</p>

<p>The Major had endeavoured several times to
interrupt her without avail. Now, when he saw
her turning quickly away, he cried vehemently:
‘Stop, my dear madam; you are quite wrong—you
misunderstand the whole affair. Do
give me time to tell you exactly what is the
matter.’</p>

<p>‘I know enough, Major; thank you very much.
I must learn the rest from John himself. Here
are some friends coming—I do not wish them
to see me in this anxious state. We can have
a chat in the afternoon.’ With a bow she walked
quickly away.</p>

<p>He would have followed, but was arrested by
a musical voice calling: ‘Major Dawkins, I wish
particularly to speak to you.’</p>

<p>He turned, and beheld Nellie Carroll advancing
hurriedly towards him. Her face was flushed,
her eyes bright with indignation, and her sharp
firm step betokened that she was in a temper.
Behind her was Stanley Maynard, looking troubled,
and evidently trying to persuade her to refrain
from some rash action.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHILDRENS_PLAY">CHILDREN’S PLAY.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">O papa</span>, when will you die?’ asked one of the
youngest of my children. A strange question,
thought I.</p>

<p>‘Why do you ask, my dear?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, because it will be such fun burying
you.’</p>

<p>This little experience of the author of <i>Olla
Podrida</i> originated in the death of a pet canary
which caused the young people great tribulation.
‘To amuse them,’ he says, ‘we made
them a paper coffin, put the defunct therein,
and sewed on the lid, dug a grave in the garden,
and dressing them out in any remnants of black
we could find for weepers, made a procession
to the grave where it was buried.’ This little
divertissement quite took their fancy, and led
them to wish for a repetition on a larger scale.</p>

<p>The memory of a back-garden little cemetery
of pet birds and kittens, over whose graves the
writer had erected head-slates with appropriate
epitaphs, occurs to him after hearing of the late
obsequies of a pet rabbit at Southport. Little
Amy’s bunnie went the way of all rabbits, and
her playmates, sympathising with her affliction,
determined to give it an appropriate funeral.
They arranged a catafalque out of a soap-box,
and with great solemnity dragged it in procession
to the grave. The children, feeling that a
service of some kind ought to be performed,
but instinctively recognising the unfitness of the
ordinary religious ritual, joined hands around
the bier, and sang with dignified pathos the
well-known old song, <i>Oh, bring back my Bunnie
to me</i>. They did it so seriously, and with such
child-like good faith, that even the grown-up
listeners behind the blinds forgot the bathos
of the situation, and involuntarily sympathised
with the young mourners in their grief. A
‘stepping-stone,’ as one of the pall-bearers afterwards
described it, was placed over the grave,
and the ceremony was over; but even the
gorgeousness of the funeral pageant and the
impressive burial service could not wholly console
the owner for the loss of her rabbit.</p>

<p>A little girl who witnessed the capture of a
rat in a trap, exclaimed, with the relentless
thoughtlessness of childhood: ‘Me wants you
to dead him, so me can see him all buried in
the seminary’—this playing at funerals being
evidently a fascinating amusement with many
little folks.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the power of imagination
in the young; but their knowledge
and experience being so incomplete, is it not
rather the imitative faculty that makes a boy
with a wooden gun act the hero or hunter, and
a girl with a rag doll, an affectionate though
rather capricious mother? On their Lilliput stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">{509}</span>
children imitate the doings of adults, who are
mainly interesting to them as furnishing subjects
for representation. They value the reproduction
more highly than the realities of life,
on which they look callously, and will parody
a funeral, an execution, or a prayer-meeting with
remarkable cheerfulness. One of the writer’s
schoolfellows, by way of appropriate ‘Sunday
play,’ once raised an altar of books, placed lighted
candles thereon, and tried to persuade some of
his companions to join him in further mummeries,
which, however, partook much less of levity than
earnestness on his part.</p>

<p>A famous American author, who makes some
observations which are very apposite, says:
‘During a walk from St Nicholas in the shadow
of the majestic Alps, we came across some little
children amusing themselves in what seemed at
first a most odd and original way; but it wasn’t;
it was in simply a natural and characteristic
way. They were roped together with a string;
they had mimic Alpenstocks and ice-axes; and
were climbing a meek and lowly manure-pile
with a most blood-curdling amount of care and
caution. The “guide” at the head of the line
cut imaginary steps in a laborious and painstaking
way, and not a monkey budged till the
step above him was vacated. If we had waited,
we should have witnessed an imaginary accident,
no doubt, and we should have heard the intrepid
band hurrah! when they made the summit, and
looked around upon the magnificent view, and
seen them throw themselves down in exhausted
attitudes for a rest in that commanding situation.’
The same writer says: ‘In Nevada, I
used to see the children play at silver-mining.
Of course the great thing was an accident in a
mine; and there were two “star” parts—that
of the man who fell down the mimic shaft; and
that of the daring hero who was lowered into
the depths to bring him up. I knew one small
chap who always insisted on playing both these
parts—and he carried his point. He would
tumble into the shaft and die; and then come
to the surface and go back after his own remains.’</p>

<p>If half the accounts of American children are
true, they must be intolerable little precocities,
hard to manage and difficult to please. Japan
appears to be the children’s paradise, from recent
accounts. In no other country, we are told, are
the young people treated with such consideration.
The third day of the month is the girls’
festival. In every family you will find dolls
in large numbers arranged in one of the rooms
reserved for that purpose. The boys’ holiday is
the fifth day of the fifth month. After passing
under the barber’s hands, the boys, dressed in
their best clothes, first go to the temple and
offer a prayer, after which the fun of the day
begins.</p>

<p>The ways of children are, it seems, beginning
to be studied from a scientific standpoint. An
American lady has elicited from two hundred
and twenty-seven Boston schoolboys particulars
of their tastes in collecting. Out of the entire
number, only nineteen had abstained from making
collections. Stamps were the most popular objects;
then marbles, business cards, minerals,
woods, leaves or flowers, autographs, buttons,
birds’ nests, and many other articles.</p>

<p>There is often a great contrast between the
ways in which boys and girls try to amuse
themselves. Games which demand small exertions
are generally girls’ favourites, though the
more active take kindly to rounders, whiptop,
and even cricket. But as a rule they are soon
tired; everything ‘isn’t fair,’ and they ‘won’t
play.’ Boys’ games are more successful. Boys
stick much more to rules, and are less careful
of their clothes. Their games are often accompanied
by loud threats and fierce recriminations,
threats which if executed would speedily make
the playground present the appearance of a
battle-field.</p>

<p>It is the grown-up people who write the
stories, and the children carefully preserve the
text. What boy has not had his Crusoe raft
or cave, or has not attempted to build a log-hut?
The business, pleasures, misfortunes, and
adventures of life are all rehearsed by the
romantic little people. There is a story of
Michael Angelo making a statue of snow in a
garden, the beauty and proportion of which
delighted his companions and gave promise of
the genius he was afterwards to display. Charles
Dickens tells us of wandering through rooms
when a child, armed with a club, in the make-belief
that he was an African traveller expecting
to be attacked at any moment by wild beasts
or savages, and therefore holding himself ready
to sell his life as dearly as possible.</p>

<p>This innate tendency to mimicry is sometimes
even displayed amongst the melancholy surroundings
of a hospital. It must, indeed, be sadly
dull for the poor little patients in a children’s
hospital, but there are rays of sunshine that
gleam upon the scene. A kind-hearted visitor
to one of these institutions says: ‘Among the
boys, I saw one merry little fellow gravely putting
out his tongue, while another felt his pulse.
Playing at doctors seemed a fit game for a
children’s hospital, and I could picture to myself
how mock prescriptions were made up with sham
solemnity of manner, and how fanciful experiments
with imaginary stethoscopes were attempted
by young actors, to beguile the weary
time. One little girl I spoke to seemed quite
proud of her acquaintance with the ailments of
her neighbours, and seriously took me to a bed
to see a bad case of “broncheetus;” and to a
cot contiguous, where what she called “new-money-here”
was waiting to be cured. To lisp
out big words like “toobercoolcrosus” appeared
to give great pleasure to the solemn little doctress,
and I fancied the patients felt some pride in
being pointed out as victims of such fine-sounding
complaints.’</p>

<p>Children who have few toys are thrown on
their own resources for amusement, and frequently
develop great ingenuity and cleverness
in their play. We have examples in the young
Brontës, busy at their desks and playing at
being editors, like the girls in <i>Little Women</i>
when producing their weekly paper <i>The Pickwick
Portfolio</i>. But when our little actors, in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">{510}</span>
eagerness to secure properties, develop the bump
of destructiveness, the results are not so amusing.
Captain Marryat remarks that children are a
great blessing when they are kept in the nursery;
but they certainly do interfere with the papa
who has the misfortune to be an author. He
little thought, when his youngest girl brought
him a whole string of paper dolls, hanging
together by the arms, that they had been cut
off his memoranda. But so it was; and when
he had satisfactorily established the fact, and
insisted upon an <i>inquisition</i> to recover his invaluables,
he found that they had had an <i>auto
da fé</i>, and that the whole string of dolls, which
contained on their petticoats his whole string
of bewitching ideas, had been burnt like so
many witches.</p>

<p>The monkey-like propensity for imitation which
makes an infant try to shave himself on getting
hold of papa’s razors, when developed in boyhood,
takes the form of surreptitious smoking
and swaggering, more for the purpose of acting
the man than for anything else. The same idea
of acting the woman is shown when little girls
improvise a long train out of a newspaper or
shawl, and sweeping in a dignified way about
the room, exclaim, ‘I’m mamma!’</p>

<p>The importance of a child when lent any
article of dress, a stick, or an umbrella to play
with, is very noticeable. ‘Little boy,’ said a
gentleman, ‘why do you hold that umbrella over
your head? It’s not raining.’ ‘No.’—‘And the
sun is not shining.’ ‘No.’—‘Then why do you
carry it?’ ‘’Cause when it rains, father wants
it; and when the sun shines, mother wants it;
and it’s only when it’s this sort of weather
that I can get to use it at all.’</p>

<p>Children possessed of mimetic qualities are
happier without any playthings than are their
opposites, even when possessed of the costliest
scientific toys. Town boys are fond of imagining
themselves to be trains and horses, the noise
of the former and motions of the latter being
often very amusingly represented. Mark Twain
has given a lively description of an American lad
imitating a river steamer with all proper accompaniments
of bell-ringing, going ahead and astern,
and whirling one arm round for an imaginary
forty-feet side-wheel coming alongside the wharf.
The same humorist’s description of some boys
camping out on an island, and covering their
bare bodies with mud to represent Indian war-paint,
will probably occur to our readers.</p>

<p>Any one who has ever watched street boys
at play, must have been struck with the power
of mimicry many of them possess. The writer
was once greatly amused by the antics of a
London lad, who along the kerbstone was ‘taking
off’ the motions of a tight-rope performer, with
most ludicrous attempts at balancing, and a
perfect burlesque of reality, that elicited roars
of laughter from his admiring companions, some
of whom whistled an appropriate accompaniment.
Stage struggles and combats, and the ways of
heavy tragedians, clowns, nigger minstrels, and
acrobats, are often travestied by these youngsters
in a way that denotes remarkable cleverness and
keen observation. A Volunteer review which
the writer witnessed in Cheshire was almost
turned into ridicule by the absurd antics of
some scores of the street arab genus. As a long
line of riflemen advanced, firing, clouds of young
ragamuffins kept retreating at some distance in
front, and at every volley threw themselves on
the ground into all kinds of grotesque attitudes,
representing the killed and wounded. Boys’
sham-fights amongst themselves sometimes become
rather serious, through the actors waxing too
earnest in their enthusiasm. It is not long since
a boy was wounded by a pistol-shot when enacting
one of the Soudan battles with his companions.
Newspaper readers are familiar with
accounts of the lamentable results of children
playing at hanging not wisely, but too well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AFTER_AN_EXPLOSION">AFTER AN EXPLOSION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> opportunity was recently afforded us of
exploring the workings of a colliery in which, a
day or two previously, an explosion had occurred.
Commonly, the results of these catastrophes are
so widespread, and the havoc they cause is so
tremendous, that it is impossible to take a calm
survey of the separate effects of fire and concussion:
all is mere ruin and confusion. But in
this particular instance the area affected had
been very limited; and so little damage had been
done to the roofs and roads, that it was safe
and easy to investigate the way in which the
imprisoned forces had effected their deadly purpose;
for nearly half the men at work in the
vein of coal had been killed, and, of the rest,
several narrowly escaped with their lives. And
yet the mine had always been considered a
perfectly safe one; no death from fire-damp had
ever before happened; and, with the full approval
of the government inspectors, naked lights had
always been used. All at once, without any
warning, the lightning-swift flame darted forth,
none knew whence, and many a miner’s home
was filled with desolation and sorrow.</p>

<p>We were, of course, provided with safety-lamps
before we reached the branch road which leads
to the workings where so lately such awful
scenes had been enacted. Even here, nearly two
hundred yards away, we were shown a hole
which had been blown through eighteen inches
of solid masonry; and were told that two men
who were at the <i>outside</i> of this wall had been
severely burned, one of them, after lingering for
a week, having succumbed to the injuries received.
Just round the corner, only a few yards away, we
saw the ghastliest sight of all that met our eyes
in this memorable round. A dark stain on one
of the upright supports of the roof marked the
place where a man’s head had been crushed by
a loaded tram, which the concussion of air had
lifted off the rails and dashed against the hapless
trammer. Nothing could give one a more vivid
conception of the terrific force of these gaseous
explosions, and of the enormous expansion of air
which they occasion.</p>

<p>But we proceed along the level road through
which so recently that fiery blast rushed, and
reach the door which opens into the actual scene
of the disaster. It was from this point that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">{511}</span>
gallant band of rescuers—who in such emergencies
are always ready to risk their lives in helping
others—carried on their operations. Outside this
door, all was safe after that one momentary
onrush of flame was over. Inside lay the deadly
choke-damp, hardly less fatal than the fire itself.
Yet, for all that, one by one the injured colliers
were carried hither and placed in the freer air.
Then the heroic searchers bore out also the bodies
of the dead; and not till then, yielded to the
numbing, stifling influence of the poisonous
vapours, which left them aching and ill for
days.</p>

<p>What a contrast to all this was the quietude
of these deserted workings as we saw them!
Save for such repairs as were needed to restore
proper ventilation, nothing had been touched;
and, strewn on the ground, as they had been
taken off by their owners—since dead, or, it
might be, struggling for life—lay the coats and
other garments discarded as too cumbersome to
work in; while from the roof hung the miners’
‘tommy-bags,’ containing their day’s food. One
had fallen on to the ground, and the mice had
got at it. After biting a hole through the covering,
they had gnawed away all the crumb out of
a huge hunch of bread. Where, one wondered,
could these tiny creatures have taken refuge from
fire and suffocation? Mysterious indeed! Not
a singe, not even the smell of fire, on these
trivial things; and yet, hereabouts, a man was
found fearfully scorched, his clothes literally torn
off him by a tornado of flame!</p>

<p>Passing on to a heading where several men met
their death, we noticed one larch-post out of
which the resin had been drawn by the intensity
of the heat; while everywhere, <i>one</i> side of the
props was coked over by the rush of burning
coal-dust, which had been driven furiously along,
now in one direction, now in another; and yet,
among it all was a pale-green shoot sprouting
from an ash-pole in the roof, turning upwards,
as if some instinct taught it <i>that</i> that way shone
the sunlight—even though a quarter of a mile of
rock lay between!</p>

<p>Another example of the incomprehensible
manner in which these fatal forces act. A door
which opened inwards, and so offered full resistance
to the concussion, was smashed into splinters;
and yet, twenty yards farther on, a miner
was at work with a candle in his cap; and
this was not blown out, nor was the man at all
hurt! This particular doorway, the door being
fortunately demolished, let in a quantity of pure
air, and so the lives of a number of men who
were in that level were saved. One specially
touching incident occurred here. Two men and
a boy started to crawl to a place of safety, following,
with their hands, the rails as a guide in the
darkness. The road they took is in the shape of
a Y. When they reached the fork, two of them
took the right turning, and escaped unscathed.
The third man went to the left, and wandered on
till, in the very thickest of the afterdamp, he sank
down and died. There he was found, as soon as
it was possible to penetrate through the smoke
and heavy fumes, with that placid look on his
face which all those wear who are suffocated by
carbonic acid gas. One of the explorers explained
that, in this poisonous atmosphere, he felt himself
failing, and yet, though he knew perfectly
what was in store for him if he sank down, <i>could</i>
not resist the pleasant stupor that was creeping
over him. He was dragged away to pure air just
in time.</p>

<p>Our guide tried, with his testing-lamp, all
round the place for gas; but only once, in a hole
in the roof of the highest level, did a tiny blue
cap within the wire-gauze demonstrate the lingering
presence of that explosive vapour. This fact
may to some extent explain the unwillingness
of the workmen to use safety-lamps. Such is
the ignorant prejudice which prevails among
them, and so true is it of them, as of all people
engaged in hazardous occupations, that familiarity
breeds contempt for danger. They were perfectly
ready to go down with candles, but <i>not</i> with
lamps, to which they had never been accustomed.
But we owe too much to these toilers underground,
to indulge in harsh criticism of their conduct.
As the poor fishwife described her herrings, so
we may call the coals which blaze upon our
hearths, ‘the lives of men.’</p>

<p>From this account of what, after all, was but
a slight explosion, one may perhaps more readily
realise the awfulness of those more extensive
disasters, which, with equal suddenness and
mystery, plunge whole districts into bitterest
grief and direst want. If any stimulus to
sympathy and practical charity were required,
it would but be needful to stand, as we did,
among that eager crowd which, at the tidings of
evil, thronged round the pit top; and to see those
agonised women who were weeping for their sons
or husbands, and ‘would not be comforted,
because they were not.’ But the hearts of
Englishmen ever beat fast, and their hands are
always open, when they are asked to help the
ill-fated colliers’ widows and orphans—‘after an
explosion.’</p>

<h3>INTERESTING DISCOVERIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A report</span> reaches us through a Greek paper
of the accidental discovery, in the island of
Syros, of three graves, the structure and contents
of which would point to a very early prehistoric
date. It was during the digging for the foundations
of a new building in the town of Hermonopolis
that these graves were brought to light.
The vessels found in them are in good preservation,
and are, with one exception, of wood or
earthenware, and this exception is a vase of
metal, in which are the ashes of a dead man.
The other graves also exhibit, without any exception,
unburned bones, thus showing a curious
combined system of ordinary burial and cremation,
the bones in the vase having been burned,
and the others not so. Votive offerings were
placed about the skeletons in every case, those
which were apparently of the greatest value
being found in the dead men’s hands. It is to
be hoped that the vessels may be secured for
the Athens Museum, already so rich with many
such curious relics. This Museum has been
lately enriched with the remains of the pediment
sculptures of the Temple of Athene Alea at
Tegea. These precious fragments, consisting of
two heads of youths and one head of a boar,
are the only pieces of sculpture which can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">{512}</span>
affirmed, with confidence, to be the work of
Scopas; and it is a satisfaction to know that
archæologists and antiquaries who desire to view
the relics of highly refined art of past ages, may
see them in this Museum without the trouble
of going to Tegea. It is also reported that the
missing half of one of the other heads lately
discovered has been found, and is now safe in
the same Museum. Another exquisitely beautiful
head of a female, found some years ago at Lerna,
has been procured for the National Museum,
thanks to the zeal and energy of the Director,
Dr Kabbadias. The head is life-size, of Parian
marble, and evidently, from the flat unworked
state of the back, formed part of a group in
high relief, and dates probably from the third
century before Christ. The learned are in much
doubt as to whom the head is intended to represent,
many inclining to the opinion that it is
Demeter, from its charming expression and
pathetic beauty; but as no part of the figure
remains, this is, after all, mere speculation.</p>


<h3>METROPOLITAN PUBLIC GARDENS’ ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>North, south, east, and west, the growth of
London proceeds rapidly. Not only is the city’s
area increased, but the brick and mortar maze
of which it consists tends to grow denser and
denser, as the nice arts of surveyor and architect
combine to wrest from space its fullest building
possibilities. And hence springs a great evil.
Fresh air and light—necessary conditions of
healthy life—are meted out to the population
with an ever-increasing meagreness. But,
happily, counteracting influences have now
existed for some time. A notable one is
embodied in a philanthropic Association, which
spends a considerable income and great activity
in obtaining for the people of London open
spaces, or gardens, and other machinery for
recreation. Old churchyards and other disused
burial-grounds, inclosed squares, and vacant plots
of ground of all sorts, are the ‘prey’ of the
Metropolitan Public Gardens’ Association. Finding
them, it at once agitates obstinately for their
consecration to public use. Parochial and ecclesiastical
local authorities, and in some cases
private individuals, are appealed to, to devote
the land to the desired purpose—the Association
offering to lay out the inclosure at its own expense,
and provide the necessary implements,
plants, mould, drains, seats, &amp;c., or making such
overtures as the individual circumstances of the
case may justify. Though securing public recreation-grounds
is the chief aim of the Association,
it adopts other means for promoting the health
and physical well-being of the people. Thus it
agitates for the establishment of gymnasia in
elementary schools, and for the opening of school
playgrounds during all but scholastic hours to
the children of the surrounding locality; it plants
trees and places seats in the wilder thoroughfares;
it uses its influence to obtain the erection of
baths and washhouses; and, collecting reliable
information respecting all the poorer districts of
the metropolis, it directs public attention to overcrowding
and other social evils. Since the Association’s
formation in 1882, it has succeeded in
eighty-three of its efforts to provide public recreation-grounds,
&amp;c., disbursing in the work
£8595, 15s. 5d. Lord Brabazon is the chairman,
Miss I. M. Gladstone, the honorary Secretary, and
Miss F. Wilkinson, the landscape gardener of the
Association, the address of which is 83 Lancaster
Gate, London, W.</p>
